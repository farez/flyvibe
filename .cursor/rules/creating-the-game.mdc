# Your rule content

- Use features available in p5js as much as possible instead of creating 
your own.
- Simplicity of gameplay over complexity.
- Always think like an entrepreneur and consider virality and ways to make 
money from the game.
- When a file becomes too long, split it into smaller files. When a function becomes too long, split it into smaller functions.
- Do not run any web server to sarve the page. I already have it running.
